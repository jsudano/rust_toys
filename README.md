# rust_toys
A collection of educational toy programs to aid in learning rust. Written as part of an onboarding crash-course for folks who are new to rust. 

## Prerequisites
Install the various rust build/compile/run tools needed to build/compile/run these projects with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

## Projects
### [telephone game](./telephone)
A primer for those very new to rust. Introduces learners to structs/enums, traits, and dynamic dispatch

### [city_info](./city_info)
A bit of a jump from telephone_game, this introduces async primitives and the tokio runtime, as well as some other common utility crates. 
Learners should be aware of [async rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) and [the tokio runtime](https://tokio.rs/).
